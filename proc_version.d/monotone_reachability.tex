\section{Results for Monotone DAG-SyDSs}
\label{sec:monotone_functions}

The class of monotone Boolean functions were defined in
Section~\ref{sec:defs}.
A monotone DAG-SyDS is a DAG-SyDS in which every local
function is monotone.
In this section, we show that the reachability problem
for monotone DAG-SyDSs can be solved efficiently.
This result is based on the following theorem. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:monotone_stable}
For a DAG monotone SyDS, every phase space cycle is a fixed point, 
and the length of any transient does not exceed the number of levels.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Proof:}~ See \cite{Rosenkrantz-etal-2020}.

\smallskip

%Theorem~\ref{thm:monotone_stable} provides polynomial bounds
%on the lengths of transients and cycles in the phase space of any
%monotone DAG-SyDS. 
The following is a direct corollary of
Theorem~\ref{thm:monotone_stable}. 

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:poly_monotone_dag_syds}
The Reachability problem is efficiently solvable for monotone
DAG-SyDSs.
\end{corollary}
