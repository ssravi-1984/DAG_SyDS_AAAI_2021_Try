\section{Convergence Guarantee for DAG-SyDSs}
\label{sec:conv_guarantee}

As mentioned earlier, \cite{Chistikov-etal-2020}
showed that the convergence
guarantee problem is \cpsp-complete for 
SyDSs on general directed graphs.
%However, they did not address the convergence guarantee problem
%for DAG SyDSs.
Here, we show that this problem 
remains computationally intractable even for
DAG SyDSs. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:convergence_guaranee}
The convergence guarantee problem for DAG SyDSs is co-NP-complete,
even when restricted to dags with three levels and 3-symmetric functions.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Proof (idea):}~ The reduction is from 3SAT \cite{GJ-1979}.
The details are given in \cite{Rosenkrantz-etal-2020}.
