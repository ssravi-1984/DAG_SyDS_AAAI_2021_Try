Discrete dynamical systems serve as useful formal models to study
diffusion phenomena in social networks.  Motivated by applications
in systems biology, several recent papers have studied algorithmic
and complexity aspects of diffusion problems for dynamical systems
whose underlying graphs are directed, and may contain directed
cycles.  Such problems can be regarded as reachability problems in
the phase space of the corresponding dynamical system. We show that
computational intractability results for reachability problems hold
even for dynamical systems on directed acyclic graphs (dags).  We
also show that for dynamical systems on dags where each local
function is monotone, the reachability problem can be solved
efficiently.
