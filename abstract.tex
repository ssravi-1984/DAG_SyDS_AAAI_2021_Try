%Diffusion problems on directed graphs are used in modeling social
%and biological phenomena. 
Discrete dynamical systems serve as a
useful formal model to study diffusion phenomena in social networks.
Several recent papers have studied algorithmic and complexity aspects of
diffusion problems for dynamical systems whose underlying graphs
are directed, and may contain directed cycles.  In particular,
[Chistikov et al. (AAAI 2020)] showed that two problems related to
convergence of opinions are \cpsp-complete
for dynamical systems whose underlying directed graphs
may contain cycles. Such problems can be regarded as
reachability problems in the phase space of the corresponding
dynamical system. We show that computational intractability
results for reachability problems hold even for dynamical systems
on directed acyclic graphs (dags). We also identify some versions
of the reachability problem that are efficiently solvable for
dynamical systems on dags.
% even though these problems are intractable
%when cycles are permitted.  Further, we establish several structural
%properties of the phase spaces of such dynamical systems.
