\paragraph{Conclusions.}


\paragraph{Open Questions.}

\begin{itemize}
\item For DAG linear SyDSs, how long can a phase space cycle and transient be,
as a function of depth.

\item For bounded degree DAG  SyDSs, how long can a phase space cycle and transient be,
as a function of depth.

\item For various classes of Boolean functions of interest, 
how long can a phase space cycle and transient be?
(If they are polynomially bounded as a function of the number of nodes,
then reachability is polynomially solvable.)
\end{itemize}
