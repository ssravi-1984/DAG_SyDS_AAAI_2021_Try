\underline{\textsf{Formal definition of a SyDS on a directed graph:}}
Let \bbb{} denote the Boolean domain \{0,1\}.
In this paper, a \textbf{Synchronous Dynamical System} (SyDS)~
\cals{} over \bbb{} is assumed to be specified as
a pair ${\cals}  = (G, {\calf})$, where
(i) $G(V,E)$, a directed graph with $|V| = n$,
represents the underlying graph of the SyDS,
with node set~$V$ and (directed) edge set~$E$, and
(ii) ${\calf} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n \}$ is a collection of
functions in the system, with
$f_i$ denoting the \textbf{local transition
function} associated with node $v_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$.
Each node of $G$ has a state value from \bbb.
Each function $f_i$ specifies the local interaction
between node $v_i$ and its in-neighbors in $G$.
The inputs to function $f_i$ are the state of $v_i$ and
those of the in-neighbors of $v_i$ in $G$;
function $f_i$ maps
each combination of inputs to a value in \bbb.
This value becomes the next state of node $v_i$.
It is assumed that each local function can be evaluated in
polynomial time.
In a SyDS, all nodes compute and update their next state
\emph{synchronously}.
Other update disciplines (e.g., sequential updates)
have also been considered in the literature (e.g., \cite{MR-2007}).
At any time $\tau$,
the {\bf configuration} \calc{} of a SyDS
is the $n$-vector $(s_1^{\tau}, s_2^{\tau}, \ldots, s_n^{\tau})$,
where $s_i^{\tau} \in \bbb$ is the state of
node $v_i$ at time $t$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$).
A \textbf{DAG-SyDS} is a SyDS whose underlying graph is a dag.

\noindent
\textbf{Example:}~ An example of a DAG-SyDS is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ex_dag_syds}.
In this example, the local functions at nodes $v_1$ through
$v_6$ are Identity, Complement, Identity, AND, OR and
XOR respectively.
(The Identity and Complement functions have only one input;
they return respectively the input value and the complement of
the input value.)
Suppose the initial configuration of the SyDS is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)$;
that is, at time $\tau = 0$, $v_1$ is in state 1, 
$v_2$ is in state 0, $\ldots$, $v_6$ is in state 0.
Recall that the inputs to the local function at a node $v$ are the current
state of $v$ and those of its in-neighbors (if any).
Since the local functions at $v_1$ and $v_3$ are Identity functions,
the states of $v_1$ and $v_3$ will remain 1 in all subsequent time steps.
Since the local function at $v_2$ is the Complement function, the state of
$v_2$ at time $\tau = 1$ is 1.
Using the local functions at $v_4$, $v_5$ and $v_6$, one can verify that
their states at time $\tau = 1$ are 0, 1 and 0 respectively.
In other words, the configuration at time $\tau = 1$ is 
$(1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0)$.
Similarly, the configuration at time $\tau = 2$ is $(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)$
and that at time $\tau = 3$ is $(1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)$.
After these steps, the SyDS cycles between the two configurations
at times $\tau =2$ and $\tau = 3$.

\underline{\textsf{Additional definitions regarding SyDSs:}}~
We now provide definitions of some additional concepts
related to SyDSs.

\begin{definition}\label{def:variable_typesl}
For the local transition function $f_v$ of a given node $v$ of a directed  SyDS,
we call the variable corresponding to the source node 
of each incoming edge to $v$ an {\bf incoming variable} of $f_v$,
and call the variable corresponding to $v$ the  {\bf self variable} of $f_v$.
\end{definition}

The \textbf{phase space} of a SyDS was defined in Section~\ref{sec:intro}.
A \textbf{transient} in phase space is a simple directed path that
leads to a directed cycle.
The length of a phase space cycle is the number of edges in the cycle,
and the length of a phase space transient is the number of edges in the transient.

Let \cals{} be a SyDS.
For a given configuration \calc{} and node $v$,
we let $\calc(v)$ denote the state of node $v$ in \calc{}.
For a given configuration \calc{} and set of nodes $Y$,
we let $\calc[Y]$ denote the projection of \calc{} onto $Y$.
We assume that the initial configuration of the system 
occurs at time 0.
For a given initial configuration \calc{} and nonnegative integer $i$,
we let $\calc_i$ denote the configuration of \cals{} at time $i$.

For a given initial configuration \calc{},
we  say that a given node $v$ is \textbf{stable} at time $t$ if
for all $i \geq t$, $\calc_i(v)= \calc_t(v)$.
Also, we say that a given node $v$ is \textbf{alternating} at time $t$ if
for all $i \geq 0$, 
$\calc_{t+2i}(v) =  \calc_t(v)$ 
and $\calc_{t+2i+1}(v) = \overline{ \calc_t(v)}$ 
(i.e., the state of $v$ alternates between 0 and 1).  
%The following lemma shows an important property of some
%nodes of a \btsyds{} whose underlying graph is a dag.


\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Graph theoretic definitions:}}~
Given a directed graph, we say that node $u$ {\bf directly precedes}
node $v$ if the graph contains an edge from $u$ to $v$,
that $u$ {\bf precedes} $v$ if the graph contains a path (possibly
with no edges) from $u$ to $v$,
and that $u$ {\bf properly precedes} $v$
if the graph contains a path with at least one edge  from $u$ to $v$.
Note that the local transition function for a given node $v$  in a
directed SyDS is a function of $v$
and the nodes that directly precede $v$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:dag_level}
Let $G(V,E)$ be a dag.
The \textbf{level} of a node $v$  in $G$ is the maximum number
of edges in any directed path to $v$.
\end{definition}

Suppose a given dag $G(V,E)$ has $L$ levels. 
For each $j$, $0 \leq j < L$, we let $\call_j$ denote the set of nodes at level $j$,
and let $\call_j'$ denote the nodes whose level is at most $j$.

\underline{\textsf{Boolean function definitions:}}~
\iffalse
%%%%%%%%%%%%% We don't discuss linear functions in the paper %%%%%%
A {\bf linear} Boolean function is one that can be expressed as a
linear equation mod 2 of its variables, i.e., the xor or complement
of the xor of its variables.  A {\bf linear SyDS} is a SyDS whose
local transition functions are all linear.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fi
Most of the definitions given here can be found in
\cite{Crama-Hammer-2011}.  Consider assignments $\alpha$ and $\beta$
to a set of Boolean variables $X$.  We say that $\alpha \leq \beta$
if for every variable $x \in X$, $\alpha(x) \leq \beta(x)$.  A
Boolean function $f$  is {\bf monotone nondecreasing} if for every
pair of assignments $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to its variables, $\alpha
\leq \beta$ implies that $f(\alpha) \leq f(\beta)$, and is {\bf
monotone nonincreasing} if for every pair of assignments $\alpha$
and $\beta$ to its variables, $\alpha \leq \beta$ implies that
$f(\alpha) \geq f(\beta)$.  We say that $f$ is {\bf monotone} if
$f$ is either monotone nondecreasing or monotone nonincreasing A
{\bf monotone SyDS} is a SyDS whose local transition functions are
all monotone.

\underline{\textsf{Problem Definitions:}}~ We now provide
formal specifications of the problems considered in this paper.
%\label{sse:prob_def}

\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Reachability} (\textsc{Reach})

\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Instance:}}~ A SyDS \cals{} specified 
by an underlying directed
graph $G(V,E)$ and a local transition function $f_v$ for each node $v \in V$,
and two configurations \calc{} and \cald{}. 

%\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Question:}}~ Starting from configuration \calc,
does \cals{} reach configuration \cald? 

We observe that \textsc{Reach} is solvable in polynomial time for
any class of SyDSs for which function evaluation can be done in
polynomial time and there is a polynomial bound on the length of a
phase space cycle and the length of a transient.  In such a case,
the given SyDS can be simulated for the required number of steps.
As will be seen, this approach is applicable to NCFs, monotone
functions (with both positive and negative monotone functions allowed
in \cals{}), and bithreshold functions.

\smallskip
\noindent
\textbf{Convergence} (\textsc{Convergence})

\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Instance:}}~ A SyDS \cals{} specified 
by an underlying
graph $G(V,E)$ and a local transition function $f_v$ for each node $v \in V$,
and a configuration \calc{}. 

%\smallskip
\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Question:}}~ Starting from configuration \calc,
does  \cals{} reach a fixed point? 

Similar to \textsc{Reach}, \textsc{Convergence} is
solvable in polynomial time for any class of SyDSs for which local function
evaluation can be done in polynomial time and there is a polynomial
bound on the length of a phase space cycle and the length of a
transient.  
%In such a case, the given SyDS can be simulated for the
%required number of steps.

\noindent
\underline{\textsf{Instance:}}~ A SyDS \cals{} specified 
by an underlying
graph $G(V,E)$ and a local transition function $f_v$ for each node $v \in V$.
